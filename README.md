# Putting the World's Vulnerable Communities on the Map
<hr>


Each year, disasters around the world kill nearly 100,000 and affect or displace 200 million people. Many of the places where these disasters occur are literally 'missing' from open and accessible maps and first responders lack the information to make valuable decisions regarding relief efforts. Missing Maps is an open, collaborative project in which you can help to map areas where humanitarian organisations are trying to meet the needs of people who live at risk of disasters and crises.

## Who we are


Missing Maps is a project led by a collective of organizations working towards a common goal of creating accessible map data where humanitarian organizations are operating. Each member organization carries out their own mapping activities with their wider communities guided by shared ethics.

Missing Maps would be nothing without this collaboration of participating organizations, communities and individuals. To achieve this goal, Missing Maps organizations grow a global community of mappers to support those living in places at risk as they put themselves on the map. OpenStreetMap is the volunteer-driven open data mapping platform which makes all of this possible, supported by the not-for-profit OpenStreetMap Foundation. Welcome to the community!

## Objectives
<ul>
   <li> To map areas where people live at risk of disasters and crises by contributing to <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org" target="_blank">OpenStreetMap</a> (OSM) so that individuals, communities and organizations can use the data and maps to better prepare and respond.</li>
   <li>To support <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org" target="_blank">OpenStreetMap</a>, specifically the <a href="https://www.hotosm.org/" target="_blank">Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team</a> (HOT), in developing technologies, skills, workflows, and communities.</li>
</ul>

## Ethics

### People

People always come before data. All Missing Maps activities will take into account the best interests and rights of the community and individuals, before adding data to OSM.

All Missing Maps project activities are guided by the humanitarian principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality and independence. We follow the <a href="https://www.hotosm.org/code-of-conduct" target="_blank">HOT code of conduct.</a>

### Open

Under the <a href="https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/" target="_blank">ODbL license</a>: Respecting the guidelines and best practices of the OpenStreetMap Foundation (OSMF) and OSM, Missing Maps project member organizations ensure that all non-sensitive data gathered under the Missing Maps project banner will be free, open and available for use.

Open to all tool creators: Any creation of Missing Maps project methodology, tools, software or technology by Missing Maps project member organizations will be open source and enable global volunteer network contribution.

Open to all voices and perspectives: All Missing Maps project activities are designed to be accessible and open for participation for individuals, communities and organizations who want to contribute towards the Missing Maps project objectives.

### Sustainable

Whenever possible, Missing Maps project activities are undertaken in collaboration with local individuals, communities, and organizations and in a respectful manner at all times.

Missing Maps project activities will build sustainable local capacity, and will ensure access to open mapping community tools and technology, and provide access to training for individuals and communities they work with.

### Collaborative

The Missing Maps community will work together to share, develop, improve and implement mapping and data collection processes.

Missing Maps member organizations will support, grow and learn from the global network of digital humanitarian volunteers.


### Quality

Missing Maps member organizations will ensure that quality assurance and control processes are in place for all of their activities. We are cautious about rapid data collection without significant local participation, and always make efforts to ensure local access.

## Membership

Membership of the the Missing Maps Project is open to any NGO, educational establishment or civil society group willing to contribute to the goals, and abide by the ethics, stated above. Approval of membership is the responsibility of the current member organisations.

## Communities

We appreciate that Missing Maps activities are often community-organized, whether it is by the existing OSM communities or by local communities of Missing Maps volunteers.

This led us to make available an editable version of the Missing Maps logo, so the communities can adapt it adding their country, or city.

<!-- Dogwood is the [theme](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/) for the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) static site generator powering [openstreetmap.us](https://openstreetmap.us). While the content for the OpenStreetMap US website is kept internal to the organization, we've decided to open source the site's theme for the benefit of the community.

Dogwood pushes the envelope of what's possible with static site generators. It supports complex sites with thousands of interconnected, customizable pages, each with their own requirements. For example, you can make a page for a person that links to and from posts they've written, event they've spoken at, and projects they're a part of.

Dogwood is under active development and is not currently versioned. Breaking changes may occur without notice, so we recommend targeting a specific commit of the project of simply forking it.

The Dogwood theme is named for Virginia's state flower, since the OpenStreetMap US [website redesign](https://openstreetmap.us/news/2023/06/website-redesign/) was announced onstage at [State of the Map US 2023](https://openstreetmap.us/events/state-of-the-map-us/2023) in Richmond, Virginia.

## Installation

Dogwood is not distributed as a Ruby gem at this time. However, can still use Dogwood as a theme for your Jekyll site.

Open your terminal and `cd` into the repo's directory. Add Dogwood as a submodule:

```
$ git submodule add https://github.com/osmus/dogwood.git
```

This will clone the theme repo into a `dogwood` folder and also add a .gitmodules file:

```
[submodule "dogwood"]
	path = dogwood
	url = https://github.com/osmus/dogwood.git
```

Next, add these lines to your Jekyll site's `Gemfile`:

```ruby
# theme
gem "osmus-dogwood", path: "dogwood"

# theme plugins
gem "absolute-urls", path: "./dogwood/_plugins/absolute-urls"
gem "post-aliases", path: "./dogwood/_plugins/post-aliases"
gem "unwrap-img", path: "./dogwood/_plugins/unwrap-img"
```

Add this line to your Jekyll site's `_config.yml`:

```yaml
theme: osmus-dogwood
```

And then execute:

```
$ bundle install
```

If you're already running your dev server you'll need to manually restart it for the config changes to take effect
