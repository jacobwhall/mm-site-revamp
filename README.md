<h1>Putting the World's Vulnerable Communities on the Map</h1>
<hr>

<p>
Each year, disasters around the world kill nearly 100,000 and affect or displace 200 million people. Many of the places where these disasters occur are literally 'missing' from open and accessible maps and first responders lack the information to make valuable decisions regarding relief efforts. Missing Maps is an open, collaborative project in which you can help to map areas where humanitarian organisations are trying to meet the needs of people who live at risk of disasters and crises.

<h2>How we work</h2>
<!--Insert image here-->



<!-- Dogwood is the [theme](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/) for the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) static site generator powering [openstreetmap.us](https://openstreetmap.us). While the content for the OpenStreetMap US website is kept internal to the organization, we've decided to open source the site's theme for the benefit of the community.

Dogwood pushes the envelope of what's possible with static site generators. It supports complex sites with thousands of interconnected, customizable pages, each with their own requirements. For example, you can make a page for a person that links to and from posts they've written, event they've spoken at, and projects they're a part of.

Dogwood is under active development and is not currently versioned. Breaking changes may occur without notice, so we recommend targeting a specific commit of the project of simply forking it.

The Dogwood theme is named for Virginia's state flower, since the OpenStreetMap US [website redesign](https://openstreetmap.us/news/2023/06/website-redesign/) was announced onstage at [State of the Map US 2023](https://openstreetmap.us/events/state-of-the-map-us/2023) in Richmond, Virginia.

## Installation

Dogwood is not distributed as a Ruby gem at this time. However, can still use Dogwood as a theme for your Jekyll site.

Open your terminal and `cd` into the repo's directory. Add Dogwood as a submodule:

```
$ git submodule add https://github.com/osmus/dogwood.git
```

This will clone the theme repo into a `dogwood` folder and also add a .gitmodules file:

```
[submodule "dogwood"]
	path = dogwood
	url = https://github.com/osmus/dogwood.git
```

Next, add these lines to your Jekyll site's `Gemfile`:

```ruby
# theme
gem "osmus-dogwood", path: "dogwood"

# theme plugins
gem "absolute-urls", path: "./dogwood/_plugins/absolute-urls"
gem "post-aliases", path: "./dogwood/_plugins/post-aliases"
gem "unwrap-img", path: "./dogwood/_plugins/unwrap-img"
```

Add this line to your Jekyll site's `_config.yml`:

```yaml
theme: osmus-dogwood
```

And then execute:

```
$ bundle install
```

If you're already running your dev server you'll need to manually restart it for the config changes to take effect
