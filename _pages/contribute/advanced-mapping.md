JOSM is a powerful OpenStreetMap editing tool that will supercharge your mapping abilities! We recommend that mappers who want to take their mapping to the next level progress to using this tool. First, you’ll need to download the application. You can do that <a href="https://josm.openstreetmap.de/wiki/Download" target="blank">here</a>. This application is available for both Macs and PCs. Compared to iD Editor, the setup process can be no picnic, so give yourself time to navigate this new tool before you plan to jump into your mapping. Once you are using JOSM you’ll never look back!
