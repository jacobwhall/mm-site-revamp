# How to participate 

## Step 1 - Start Mapping

It is no problem if you have never mapped before. It doesn't take long to learn - just about an afternoon! If you already know how to edit OpenStreetMap (OSM), feel free to just <a href="https://tasks.hotosm.org/" target="_blank">get started</a>.

If you're new to mapping, we recommend you keep reading, and watch the videos below to get set up. If you've mapped before, consider learning to validate. There are also additional tutorials available on <a href="https://learnosm.org/en/coordination/humanitarian/" target="_blank">LearnOSM</a>.


### Beginners - Start Here!

## Step 2 -  Map your community 
Many organizations are using OSM to inform their programs. OSM is great for collecting field data while empowering communities. If you are interested in creating and using data from OSM in your work, these guides will help you get started.
