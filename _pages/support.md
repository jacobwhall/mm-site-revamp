A donation to the <a href="https://www.hotosm.org/donate/" target="_blank">Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team</a> (one of the founders of Missing Maps) can help support local people to map their own communities, develop tools and processes so that more people can contribute, and scale this work so that even more responders and humanitarian organisations around the world have maps and open data that enable them to make time-critical, data-driven decisions.
